## The Math
A series of apps to help visualize and understand the exhibits at the museum better. Using collision detection and thresholding to understand the properties of Reuleaux shapes, basic kinematic formulas to visualize curves of the trajectory of a thrown object and sin waves to show the movement of the Dynamic Wall

## The Submission
The idea of the app is to have the visitors experience an entire other layer to the museum. Ideally starting with a QR code to install or link the app and then tracking the Floor Maps to keep track and visualize which AR additions they've visited. The idea was to supplement the the exhibits without detracting from them. The initial thought for coaster rollers was the fact that it was difficult to visualize and understand the constant diameter of the acorns, having a 3D model to be able to roll and measure helps visitors understand their unique properties. For Hoop Curves the idea was to allow visitors to practice and visualize the trajectory before using the exhibit, its often a popular attraction and would allow visitors to have a taste while they wait. Lastely the Dynamic Wall app is to visualize the the underlying function (in this case a simple sin function) transforming the wall.
